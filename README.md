# Stephen_Curry_picture_ML_training
Clustering and PCA training

For this project I took the image of the GOAT basketball player, broke it into pieces and restored it using Python ML models. 

We can use this projrct for "Guess the celebrity" game. 

Basically what it does - it blures the image -> it restores the certain percentage of broken images.

IBM ML trainig project 2.
